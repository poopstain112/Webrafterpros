  "What sets you apart from your competitors? What's your unique approach or what makes you different from others in your field?",
  
  "Where are you located and what area do you serve? Do customers come to you, do you go to them, or both?",
  
  "What's the personality of your brand? Are you more professional and trustworthy, friendly and approachable, or maybe premium and exclusive? How do you want people to feel when they interact with your business?",
  
  "What's the best way for customers to reach you? I'll need your phone number, email, address, and business hours. Also, do you prefer calls, texts, emails, or online booking?",
  
  "Do you have specific brand colors or design preferences? What style would appeal to your ideal customers - modern and clean, warm and welcoming, bold and vibrant?",
  
  "Finally, what's the main action you want website visitors to take? Call you immediately, book an appointment, request a quote, or something else?",
  
  "Great! Now please upload your business logo and tell me your slogan or tagline (if you have one). This will help brand your website perfectly.",
  
  "Perfect! I have everything I need to create your professional website. Now please upload 1-10 high-quality photos of your work, location, or team so I can build a site that truly represents your business."
